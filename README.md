## overview
This repository aims to explore the causal relationship between education level (EDUC) and long-term mortality (DEATH) using observational data from the [Framingham Heart Study’s dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aasheesh200/framingham-heart-study-dataset).

Methodologically, the investigation involves two main steps:

- Defining the directed acyclic graph (DAG) based on expert knowledge.
- Employing G-computation and the Propensity Score Method with inverse probability weighting to quantify the causal relationship between EDUC and DEATH.
